# CSC1008_DSA_Project
SG JourneyPlanner is an application that assist our users in finding the most effective way to travel from point A to point B. In this application, we cover the whole Singapore area. We also include algorithms like hashing, dijsktra and mergesort, to complete our assignment. As for structures, we used 

## Algorithms used:
1. Hashing Algorithm
2. Dijsktra Algorithm
3. MergeSort Algorithm

## Data Structures used:
1. Priority Queue
2. Array List

## Installing Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Datasets:
We used different JSON datasets for the codes

### Bus Stops Datasets:
1. Bus Stops Dataset: allcoords.json
2. Routes for busses: busroutes.json
3. Border for map: sgborder.json

# Usage:
1. Run file pyqtgui.py
2. Input start and end location
3. Check box for Shortest Journey with more bus transfer
4. Click Calculate Route
